## Overview

I Built cat wiki by following challenge by devchallenges.io. You can look my site here [Cat Wiki](https://alvindev-catwiki.vercel.app/). From this challenge, I have learned about Server Side Rendering and API Routes using Next JS. I think my solution is not optimal, especially in the top breeds sections. In that section, I only added the top 10 breeds taken from a website because I was still confused about how to get the top 10 most searched breeds from the API. I hope you all can give me some feedback about my solution :)
